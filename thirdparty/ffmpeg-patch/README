Here is a way to force rebuild after we modified ffmpeg/libavformat code

0. make sure the vlc code is built from scratch.
1. change ffmpeg, modify source code from libav-xxx/libavformat/flv.h, flvdec.c, etc
2. remove the .ffmpeg file to force rebuild
3. modify vlc/extras/package/ios/build.sh to remove the line "make fetch" which will NOT download anything from vlc github root
4. modify buildMobileVLCKit.sh to remove the line: git reset --hard ${TESTEDHASH} git am ../../patches/*.patch to force update the code(build.sh).
5. package the source code and save it as ~/Develop/vlc-iOS/VLCKit/MobileVLCKit/ImportedSources/vlc/contrib/tarballs/ffmpeg-HEAD.tar.gz
6. run the build sh ./buildMobileVLCKit.sh -d -s -v from VLCKit

It's awkward.
