Here is a way to force rebuild after we modified ffmpeg/libavformat code

0. run the build sh ./buildMobileVLCKit.sh -d -s -v to make sure the vlc code is built from scratch.
1. change ffmpeg, modify source code from libav-xxx/libavformat/flv.h, flvdec.c, etc
2. remove the .ffmpeg file to force rebuild
3. package the source code and save it as ~/Develop/vlc-iOS/VLCKit/MobileVLCKit/ImportedSources/vlc/contrib/tarballs/ffmpeg-HEAD.tar.gz
4. run the build sh ./buildMobileVLCKit.sh -d -s -v -n from VLCKit (-n means no network)
5. Goto /Users/wminghao/Develop/GroupVoip.git/trunk/ios-client, run ./cplibfiles.bat, to copy the release files to the iosClient project
6. commit the library files to the iosClient project.

It's awkward.
