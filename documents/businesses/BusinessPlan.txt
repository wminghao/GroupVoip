- Traditional Karaoke businesses.

  The on-line solution we offer is significantly more flexible and easily
  accessible via smart phone, pads, or mobile desktops. With songs fetched
  on-line, our collection of songs can not be matched by individual shops
  running on DVD discs. It's easier for consumer to get connected with
  friends and family w/o the need to be in the same physical location.

  While the solution having edge over traditional business model, we
  can partner instead of going head-on competition against individual 
  Karaoke shops. The on-line solution helps to cut their cost while
  making the original contents more readily accessible to them. 

- Existing Smart Phone Applications that Enable Karaoke

  There are existing solution allows people to sing along: 
  * Just sing it
  * Smule Sing
  * Yokee
  * Disney Karaoke
  * Singsnap
  * Stage it (Live)
  * Backstage Pass
  None of them offer a real-time solution as we do.
