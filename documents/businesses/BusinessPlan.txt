We are providing a Internet-based platform for music lovers to sing Karaoke 
on-line and social with their friends, families, and people 
of similar interest.

Our core values:

1. High quality audio and video

We provide studio-level audio and high definition video for users 
to sing karaoke.

Users can sing karaoke and video chat with friends and fans in real-time. 
Singers and listeners can see each other, and interact as if they are 
in the same room.

~ Target Market and Customer Segments 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The general population who listen to songs and sing as a hobby or sing during
social occasions are our targeted customer base. The primary segment in this 
consumer base are the teenager girls who spend significant amount of time 
following popular music and practicing singing. They typically have time,
passion, and interest to sing over the Internet with friends and fans. 

Our service will start in the US where there no established service of 
the similar kind. While the China market appears already crowded with
established players, the US and western markets at large are more 
or less untapped.  

Our basic service will be provided for free to the general public while 
premiums will be collected over value added services, including
- higher quality video in terms of lower latency and/or higher resolution
- recording that requires storage on our servers
- sending rewards/virtual gifts to singers.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ Key Assets 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have acquired the following key assets at the time:

1) Our technologies developed to deliver real-time mixed high-quality Video/Audio 
   streams over the Internet to mobile devices.
 
2) Technical expertises our founders have accumulated in Video/Audio and networking 
   areas over the years working for leading technology companies in the Silicon 
   Valley.

The contents we need can be obtained for free initially from other websites
like youtube. The copyright issues have been addressed already by these 
players. We need to follow what they have been doing.

1) Most songs are uploaded from those listing services themselves.

#RL#   Who are they?

2) The songs on youtube has default people singing in the background.
3) The songs are not comprehensive as what's available from paid service.

Moving forward, we plan to form partnership with the musiv video providers.

1) Karaoke Cloud

~ Competition Analysis 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Traditional Karaoke businesses.

  The on-line solution we offer is significantly more flexible and easily
  accessible via smart phone, pads, or mobile desktops. With songs fetched
  on-line, our collection of songs can not be matched by individual shops
  running on DVD discs. It's easier for consumer to get connected with
  friends and family w/o the need to be in the same physical location.

  While the solution having edge over traditional business model, we
  can partner instead of going head-on competition against individual 
  Karaoke shops. The on-line solution helps to cut their cost while
  making the original contents more readily accessible to them. 

- Existing Smart Phone Applications/Website that Enable Karaoke

  There are existing solution allows people to sing along:
  
  Singing Social Networks

  None of them offer a high interactivity real-time solution as we do. 
  All of them provides an online platform or tool for people to sing.

- Existing Live On-line Karaoke services in other markets

  There are successful live on-line Karaoke services provided in China.
  While their service is available to customer in US, we see several
  major factors holding them back from acceptance in the US markets
  1) inferior technologies 
  2) language and Culture differences
  3) extra latency due to physical distance between US markets and
     video severs located in China. (not noticeable for broadcast)

  Major competing on-line Karaoke service in China markets
  - 9158 (Video focused, up to 3 broadcasters to many, > 300million user, public company)
  - yy (Audio focused, 1 broadcaster to many, >400million users, public company)
  - kk (Similar to yy)

- Our Competitive Advantages

  We have acquired the key technologies that enable more impressive singing 
  experiences compared to what's offered by the existing players in
  the China markets.

   1) Technologies to produce Karaoke audio effects. 
   2) Technologies to deliver high-definition real-time video over Internet 
      from interactive virtual singing rooms.
   3) Seamless cross-platform experience between mobile and desktop platforms. 
      (Patent pending.)
   4) Technologies to mix between music video streams and streams from 
      singing sessions.
   5) Technologies to scale to large amount of simultaneous users.

  While the players from China market can expand their services to the
  US, we have the advantages compared to them.
  - Better understanding of the customer and market.
  - Better connection to technology providers needed for the intended business. ???
  - No language and culture barrier.
