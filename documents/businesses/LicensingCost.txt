The contents we need can be obtained for free initially from other websites
like youtube. The copyright issues have been addressed already by these
players. We need to follow what they have been doing.

1) Most songs are uploaded by a few listing services(Karaoke Cloud/Karafun) themselves.
2) The songs on youtube has default people singing in the background.
3) The songs are not comprehensive as what's available from paid service.

Moving forward, we plan to form partnership with the musiv video providers.
